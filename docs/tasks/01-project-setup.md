# Project Setup

## Objectives

- Initialize npm package structure
- Configure TypeScript
- Set up testing framework
- Configure build pipeline
- Set up documentation generation

## Tasks

1. ✅ Create package.json with appropriate metadata
   - Created with core dependencies (@supabase/ssr, @supabase/supabase-js)
   - Added development dependencies (typescript, eslint, prettier, etc.)
   - Configured scripts for build, test, lint, and docs

2. ✅ Set up TypeScript configuration
   - Configured tsconfig.json with appropriate compiler options
   - Set up proper module resolution
   - Added declaration file generation

3. ✅ Configure ESLint and Prettier
   - Added .eslintrc.js with React and TypeScript support
   - Added .prettierrc for consistent code formatting
   - Fixed initial linting issues in the codebase

4. ✅ Set up Vitest for testing
   - Added vitest configuration for unit testing
   - Configured test utilities and setup files
   - Added integration with React Testing Library

5. ✅ Configure build process with TypeScript compiler
   - Simplified build process using TypeScript's tsc compiler
   - Added source map generation for debugging
   - Configured clean build process with rimraf

6. ✅ Set up documentation generation with TypeDoc
   - Added typedoc.json configuration
   - Configured automatic documentation generation

## Completion Status

The project setup task has been completed. Key accomplishments:

- Successfully configured and tested the build process with TypeScript
- Fixed all linting issues in the codebase
- Set up a clean, simplified build pipeline that avoids complex bundler configurations
- Added proper testing framework with Vitest and React Testing Library
- Configured documentation generation with TypeDoc

## Next Steps

The project structure is now ready for development of the core authentication features:

1. Create a feature branch for task 02 (Database and Migrations)
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/02-database-migrations
   ```

2. Implement the required database schema and migrations
3. Write comprehensive tests for the database layer
4. Document the database schema and migration process
5. Create a small, focused PR for review

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ Package can be built successfully
✅ Tests can be run with a single command
✅ Documentation can be generated automatically
✅ ESLint and Prettier are configured and working
⏳ CI/CD pipeline is set up for testing and publishing (to be added in a future task)
