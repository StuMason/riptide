# API Token Management

## Objectives

- Implement API token creation
- Create token scopes functionality
- Set up token revocation
- Implement token usage tracking
- Integrate security features for token management

## Tasks

1. Create token interfaces and types
2. Implement token creation functionality
3. Create token scopes (read, write, admin)
4. Implement secure token generation and storage
5. Add CSRF protection for token operations
6. Implement token revocation with proper validation
7. Set up token usage tracking
8. Implement rate limiting for token operations
9. Create hooks for token management
10. Implement token validation middleware with proper authentication

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can create API tokens with specific scopes
- Token is generated securely and shown only once after creation
- Users can view a list of their active tokens
- Token list shows creation date and last used timestamp
- Users can revoke tokens with proper authentication
- Tokens are properly validated when used for API access
- Token scopes are properly enforced
- Rate limiting protects against abuse of token operations
- CSRF protection is implemented for all token forms
- All token functions have appropriate hooks for React
